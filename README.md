# Google Summer of Code Projects in the [Cimini Lab](https://cimini-lab.broadinstitute.org/) at the [Broad Institute Imaging Platform](https://www.broadinstitute.org/imaging) 

The Broad Institute Imaging Platform (est 2007) is a group of computational biologists and computationalists who work to create methods, software, and workflows designed to turn light microscopy images into answered questions. The Cimini lab (est 2021) creates and maintains a number of open-source software tools for those purposes.

Below are the projects we are hoping may be of some interest for GSoC 2025 hopeful-contributors! Feel free to reach out to bcimini AT broadinstitute DOT org if you want to propose something in one of our projects but not listed below (or even better, hop into the Issues and/or Discussions for the project!)

## How to apply

## Projects we are looking for help with

### CellProfiler

[CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/) is an open-source image analysis workflow tool written in Python. It allows users to assemble no-code workflow pipelines to apply to however many images they have, whether that is 100 or 1,000,000.

### Piximi

[Piximi](https://piximi.app/) is an open-source image analysis client-side web-app written in TypeScript. It is an "Images to Discovery" platform that allows users to upload images, segment and/or classify them with deep learning, and then measure them all without installation or the data needing to leave their machine.

### Bilayers

[Bilayers](https://bilayers.org/) is an open-source image analysis specification and CI/CD, which involves containerization, a LinkML-based specifiation, and Jinja templating. It is designed to allow bioimage analysts to describe any containerized tool or algorithm in a human-readable config file, and to use that config file to automatically create GUI tool versions as well as interfaces to other tools (such as CellProfiler).
